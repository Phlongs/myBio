  <p>Started development career in early 2017 in which I had to manage an aggressive start.  Prior, I had no clue on how to print "Hello World" to the DOM. The intensive labor I had to put into a 24 week program at GA Tech helped me understand the unlimited potential I saw in myself.  Learning different languages and frameworks all in a short amount of time was a daunting yet most rewarding experience. I am excited to see what the future holds. </p>
  <p>Experienced in HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, JQuery, Bootstrap, Angular JS, Firebase, Node Js, MySQL, MongoDB, Express, ReactJS, Meteor & Handlebars JS. </p>
